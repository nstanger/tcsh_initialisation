# Set up an alias for running EPrints scripts. This would normally
# go in one of the aliases files, but it requires the PERL5LIB
# environment variable, which is set up by the Fink initialisation.
# Fink initialisation occurs *after* the various alias files have
# been read (see login.shared for the explanation why). We therefore
# have to create the alias here.
